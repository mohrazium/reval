# Intelligent Task Management App - Development Roadmap

## 🎯 Project Overview
This mobile app helps users manage daily routines like work, exercise, and rest, while intelligently scheduling personal development tasks (e.g., programming projects, online courses) during rest periods based on energy levels. It solves the problem of time-consuming manual planning by using AI to create optimized schedules, suggest task issues, interact with users on progress, and integrate with GitHub for issue management, Markdown/Obsidian for note storage, and SMS for notifications. Target users are individuals seeking efficient personal productivity with AI assistance.

## 🏗️ Architecture Analysis
Based on your project requirements, I've identified **4 main phases**:

1. **📋 Phase 1: Backend Foundation (Server-side)** - Focuses on building the core API, database, authentication, and initial AI integration for task scheduling and suggestions.
   - Sub-phases: API Development & Database Design, Authentication & Security, AI Integration Setup, Business Logic Implementation.

2. **📋 Phase 2: Mobile App Core Development (Client-side)** - Develops the Flutter-based mobile interface for user interactions, core screens, and local storage.
   - Sub-phases: App Architecture & Navigation, Core Screens & Components, Local Storage & State Management, API Integration & Network Layer.

3. **📋 Phase 3: Integration & Advanced Features** - Handles integrations with external services like GitHub API, SMS, Markdown/Obsidian sync, and advanced AI features for interactive suggestions.
   - Sub-phases: Third-party Integrations, Advanced AI & Real-time Features, Performance Optimization, Frontend-Backend Full Integration.

4. **📋 Phase 4: Testing, Deployment & Launch** - Ensures quality through testing, sets up deployment, and prepares for app store release with monitoring.
   - Sub-phases: Comprehensive Testing Strategy, DevOps & CI/CD Setup, Production Deployment, Monitoring & Maintenance Setup.

This architecture ensures a logical progression from backend core to mobile UI, then integrations, and finally deployment, allowing for early testing of AI scheduling while accommodating your mobile-first approach and AI dependencies.
